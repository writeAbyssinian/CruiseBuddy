# [TC] Helper

[TC] Helper was created out of passion for [TC] community and as a project for learning new programming language. Idea of this tool is to give some extra capabilities on top of existing InSim of [TC] servers.
You're welcome to suggest new ideas which would extend this tool and make it more essential for everyone.

[TC] Helper will work only while playing on [TC] CityDriving (https://city-driving.co.uk) servers.

## Current Functionalities
### Notifications
Audible configured notifications for various events like SOS calls, AFK warning and chat mentions.
Set specific audible notification for when getting a tow call, police call or when someone is reporting a danger or requesting a support.
Includes AFK warning notification so you can get back into the game before you get kicked and Chat Mention notification so you won't miss a message when someone uses your name in the chat.

### Tracker and Quick-Spectate (Peeking)
Automated tracker which sets a tracked player when responding to a call. You can also manually select a player to track.
Tracking gives you a chance to peek at the player while holding a configured keybind which can be changed any time.
> Peeking is not available while in a chase as it would give unfair advantage.
